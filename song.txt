Well, I've been to Hastings and I've been to Brighton
I've been to Eastbourne too
So what, so what
And I've been here, I've been there
I've been every fucking where
So what, so what
So what, so what, you boring little cunt

But who cares, who cares what you do
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you

Well, I've fucked a queen, I've fucked Bach
I've even sucked an old man's cock
So what, so what
And I've fucked a sheep, I've fucked a goat
I rammed my cock right down its throat
So what, so what
So what, so what, you boring little fuck

But who cares, who cares what you do
And, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you
